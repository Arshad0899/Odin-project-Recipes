            This is a delicious Indian rice dish which is 
            often reserved for very special occasions such as weddings, 
            parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy 
            preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For 
            biryani, always use long grain rice. Basmati rice with its 
            thin, fine grains is the ideal variety to use. Ghee is butter 
            that has been slowly melted so that the milk solids and golden 
            liquid have been separated and can be used in place of vegetable 
            oil to yield a more authentic taste.
