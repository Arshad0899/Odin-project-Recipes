            <li>Rice raw 1/2 cup</li>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Wash rice two to three times, clean and soak in fresh water for 
                at least two to three hours. Wash and soak the dal also for a 
                similar time. Add the methi seeds to the soaking dal. Drain and 
                grind the rice to a slightly coarse texture and dropping 
                consistency. Drain and grind the dal, sprinkling water as 
                required to a smooth and spongy batter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix both the batters with salt with hand, thoroughly in a whipping motion. Keep the 
                batter in a large vessel, close tightly and rest the batter in 
                a warm place for at least 24 hours. Mix the batter well and 
                pour into lightly oiled idly trays and steam for about ten 
                minutes. Dip a toothpick into the idli to check if done. 
                Remove from the steamer, sprinkle water on the idli and 
                remove from the moulds. Keep it covered in a moist cloth 
                till serving time.
